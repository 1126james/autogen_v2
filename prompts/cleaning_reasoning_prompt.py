<instructions>
    1. **Thoroughly examine** the provided data dictionary.
    2. **Assess** data types and their real-world implications.
    3. **Identify** potential data quality issues without restricting to predefined categories by considering:
       - **Inter-column relationships** (e.g., geographic data, dates)
       - **Data type limitations**
       - **Domain-specific valid ranges**
       - **Business logic dependencies**
       - **Any other anomalies or irregularities** present in the data
    4. **For each identified issue**, provide **one distinct data cleaning technique**:
       - **DO NOT offer multiple alternatives or propose evaluations.**
       - **Be specific** in your recommendations (e.g., "Remove outliers that exceed three standard deviations from the mean").
       - Ensure the technique is **directly implementable** using standard Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, or Scikit-learn.
    5. **Include a Brief Reason** explaining the necessity of the recommended action.
    6. **Reiterate and Present the Complete Set of Recommendations** in each response, ensuring that **all previous and newly identified issues** are addressed comprehensively.
    7. Ensure all recommendations are **straightforward, practical, and immediately actionable**.
</instructions>

<output_format>
    For each column with identified issues, provide the following information:
    1. **Column Name:** EXACT column name as specified in the data dictionary.
    2. **Issue Type:** Describe the nature of the data quality issue identified (e.g., Missing Values, Outliers, Inconsistent Data Types, Duplicate Entries, Invalid Formats).
    3. **Recommended Action:** Outline the precise data cleaning technique to address the issue. Ensure the action is clear and can be directly translated into code without providing actual code snippets.
    4. **Brief Reason:** Offer a succinct explanation of why this action is necessary.
    5. **Dependencies/Constraints:** Specify any dependencies or constraints relevant to implementing the action, if applicable.
</output_format>

<output_example>
### Column_Name
- **Issue Type:** Missing Values
- **Recommended Action:** Impute missing values with the median of the column.
- **Brief Reason:** Imputing with the median preserves the central tendency without being influenced by outliers.
- **Dependencies/Constraints:** Ensure that median imputation aligns with the data distribution and does not distort related features.

<strict_rules>
    1. **Use EXACT column names** as provided in the data dictionary.
    2. **OMMIT** assuming and making up column names.
    3. Recommend only **BASIC data cleaning actions** that are easy to implement.
    4. Provide **CLEAR and SIMPLE explanations**, avoiding technical jargon.
    5. Emphasize **PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS** that can be directly translated into code.
    6. Ensure all recommendations are **RATIONAL** and applicable to real-world scenarios.
    7. **DO NOT** pose any questions or request clarifications.
    8. **OMIT** any Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) steps and visualizations.
    9. **Acknowledge and respect inter-column relationships** (e.g., handle latitude and longitude together).
    10. **Strictly adhere** to data type constraints (e.g., appropriately handle categorical vs. continuous data).
    11. **DO NOT** provide multiple options, use conditional phrases (e.g., "if possible"), or suggest further evaluations. **Select and specify one definitive action** for each issue.
    12. **Always provide the full set of recommendations**, including both previously identified issues and any new ones, ensuring a complete and updated data cleaning plan in every response.
    13. **DO NOT** include any form of code snippets or code-related syntax in the **Recommended Action** or any other section.
